Sorting Algorithms
General Objective
...This repository provides implementations of at least four different sorting algorithms. Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and plays a crucial role in various applications. The objective of this project is to explore and understand different sorting algorithms, analyze their time complexities, and provide insights on selecting the most appropriate algorithm for a given input dataset.

...This repository includes implementations of several sorting algorithms, including:

>>Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues to do this until no more swaps are needed.

>>Insertion Sort: Another elementary sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

>>Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

>>Quick Sort: A highly efficient and widely used sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy. It picks an element as a "pivot" and partitions the array around the pivot, putting elements smaller than the pivot on the left and elements greater than the pivot on the right.

...Big O Notation
The Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the upper bound or worst-case scenario of an algorithm's time complexity. It provides a way to analyze and compare the efficiency of different algorithms. Understanding the Big O notation is crucial for evaluating and selecting sorting algorithms.

...Evaluating Time Complexity
To evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm, we consider factors such as the number of comparisons, swaps, and operations an algorithm performs relative to the size of the input dataset. In this repository, we analyze and document the time complexities of each sorting algorithm implemented.

...Selecting the Best Sorting Algorithm
Choosing the best sorting algorithm for a specific task depends on various factors, including the size of the dataset, the initial order of elements, and available memory. We provide insights and guidelines on how to select the most suitable sorting algorithm for a given input scenario.

...Stable Sorting Algorithm
A stable sorting algorithm preserves the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output as they appeared in the original input. Understanding stability is important when dealing with datasets where element equality matters. We indicate which sorting algorithms in this repository are stable.

 Happy sorting!
